            <p class="fs-5">forEach just loop over the array and executes the callback but filter executes the callback and
                check its return value.. map creates a new array by transforming every element in an array individually. filter
                creates a new array by removing
                elements that don't belong. The find() method is used to find all the descendant elements of the selected
                element. It finds the element in the DOM
                tree by traversing through the root to leaf. The filter() method is used to filters all the elements and returns
                the
                element that matches and the element that do not match are removed.</p>

            <p class="fs-5"><strong>Arrow Function: </strong>arrow functions do not have their own this . The value of this
                inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the
                lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function <br>
        
                <strong>Regular Function: </strong>Regular functions have their own this.

                <h2>What is the differenve between var, let, const</h2>

            <p class="fs-5">
                <strong>Var: </strong>It can be declared without initialization.In JavaScript, var is a reserved keyword which is followed by a reference variable name. The name defined after the
                keyword can then be used as a pointer to the data in-memory. <br>
                <strong>let: </strong>It can be declared without initialization. The let declaration was introduced with ES6 and has since become the preferred method for variable declaration. It is
                regarded as an improvement over var declarations and is block-scoped (variables that can be accessed only in the
                immediate block), circumventing the main issue that can arise with using var. <br>
                <strong>const: </strong>It cannot be declared without initialization.The const declaration was introduced with ES6, alongside let, and it is very similar to let. const points to data in
                memory that holds constant values, as the name implies. const reference variables cannot be reassigned to a different
                object in memory
